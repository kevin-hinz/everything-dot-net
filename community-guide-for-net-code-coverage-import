As explained in our [Test Coverage 149](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/test-coverage/dotnet-test-coverage/) documentation, SonarQube/SonarCloud **does not** run tests or generate reports, but **imports** pre-generated reports from another source. The goal of this guide is show how to troubleshoot and correct typical code coverage import issues into SonarQube/SonarCloud for C# and VB.NET languages. If you are interested in troubleshooting unit test results and execution reporting instead, see “Import unit test results” section of [\[Coverage & Test Data\] Generate Reports for C#, VB.net 746](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871).

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#prerequisites-1)Prerequisites

We support the following code coverage tools:

-   Visual Studio Code Coverage
-   dotCover
-   OpenCover/Coverlet

If you do not use any of the above code coverage tools, code coverage import will not work.

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#fundamentals-2)Fundamentals

Understand the basics of…

-   SonarScanner for .NET (formerly known as SonarScanner for MSBuild) by reading its [documentation 312](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/)
-   Integration with Azure DevOps/TFS environment (if you are using Azure DevOps/TFS)
    -   Understand the link between Azure DevOps and SonarCloud by reading this [SonarCloud Azure DevOps Lab 121](https://azuredevopslabs.com//labs/vstsextend/sonarcloud/).
        
    -   How code coverage test files are automatically detected as explained in the [Code Coverage 663](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/#header-5) section for SonarScanner for .NET:
        
        -   Auto-search for `.trx` files in any TestResults folder located under the $Build.SourcesDirectory path (otherwise, check $Agent.TempDirectory path)
        -   Auto-search for CodeCoverage.exe path by searching in `VsTestToolsInstallerInstalledToolLocation` environment variable (set by the “VsTestToolsPlatformInstaller” task or by the user)
        -   `.coverage` auto-converts to `.coveragexml` via CodeCoverage.exe
    -   Know how to construct your pipeline correctly
        
        -   Install appropriate platform dependencies
        -   “Prepare Analysis Configuration” task contains proper code coverage parameters
        -   “Run Code Analysis” and “Publish Quality Gate Result” tasks are also added to your pipeline

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#do-the-reports-even-exist-6)Do the reports even exist?

-   If you see the following, then ensure the report generation for your code coverage tool actually produced a file and has content in it.
    
    > ```
    > WARN: The Code Coverage report doesn’t contain any coverage data for the included files.
    > ```
    
-   Verify indexed paths compared to coverage file paths  
    (see [Code Coverage is not shown in the SonarCloud.io - #6 by sconde 239](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/code-coverage-is-not-shown-in-the-sonarcloud-io/15218/6))
    
    -   The `/p:PathMap` option of MSBuild is not supported for coverage files parsed in SonarQube or SonarCloud.

-   When importing code coverage reports, you need to ensure that you specify the report path with your associated code coverage tool’s property for the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe or dotnet `begin` command, as detailed in [Test Coverage 149](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/test-coverage/dotnet-test-coverage/):
    
    -   `sonar.cs.vscoveragexml.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to Visual Studio Code coverage report for C#. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited, or included via wildcards.
        -   Ensure that you have converted the code coverage report from Binary into XML (see “Convert the Code Coverage Report from Binary into XML” section on our [\[Coverage & Test Data\] Generate Reports for C#, VB.net 746](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871) Community guide)
    -   `sonar.cs.dotcover.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to dotCover coverage report for C#.
    -   `sonar.cs.opencover.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to OpenCover coverage report for C#.
    -   `sonar.vbnet.vscoveragexml.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to Visual Studio Code Coverage report for VB.NET. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited, or included via wildcards. See [.NET Test Coverage 149](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/test-coverage/dotnet-test-coverage/) for more information.
    -   `sonar.vbnet.dotcover.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to dotCover coverage report for VB.NET.
    -   `sonar.vbnet.opencover.reportsPaths`
        -   Path to OpenCover coverage report for VB.NET.
-   SonarScanner for .NET has automatic detection of `sonar.cs.vscoveragexml.reportsPaths` and `sonar.cs.vstest.reportsPaths` if the proper `.trx` and `.coverage` files have been found in specific folders. See [Code Coverage 663](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/#header-5) section for more information on these analysis parameters can be auto-set.

-   Make sure you understand the regular expression for matching files and directories:
    
    | Symbol | Meaning |
    | --- | --- |
    | ? | a single character |
    | \* | any number of characters |
    | \*\* | any number of directories |

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#do-you-know-how-to-get-debug-logs-10)Do you know how to get debug logs?

-   Add `/d:"sonar.verbose=true"` to the…
    -   SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe or dotnet `begin` command to get more detailed logs
        -   For example: `SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:"MyProject" /d:"sonar.verbose=true"`
    -   “SonarQubePrepare” or “SonarCloudPrepare” task’s `extraProperties` argument if you are using Azure DevOps
        -   For example:
            
            ```
            # Applies to SonarQubePrepare as well
            - task: SonarCloudPrepare@1
                inputs:
                  SonarCloud: 'sonarcloud'
                  organization: 'zucchinibreadco'
                  scannerMode: 'MSBuild'
                  projectKey: 'zuchhinibreadco_sonar-scanning-someconsoleapp'

                    sonar.verbose=true
            ```
            
-   The parsing and import of code coverage happens during the Scanner for MSBuild `end` command (a.k.a. the Azure DevOps “SonarQubeAnalyze” or “SonarCloudAnalyze” task).

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#prematurely-running-report-generation-12)Prematurely running report generation

The report generation process must be executed after the build step and before the scanner `end` step. The following steps detail importing .NET reports:

1.  Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe (or dotnet) `begin` command, specifying the absolute path where the reports will be available using the `/d:propertyKey="path"` syntax (“propertyKey” depends on the tool)
2.  Build your project using MSBuild (or dotnet)
3.  Run your test tool, instructing it to produce a report at the same location specified earlier to the MSBuild/dotnet SonarQube runner (see [How to generate reports with different tools 746](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871))
4.  Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe (or dotnet) `end` command

Read the [ProjectCategorisation 87](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-msbuild/wiki/Analysis-of-product-projects-vs.-test-projects#project-categorisation) section to better understand if the project not having code coverage may be considered a test project.

## [](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-troubleshooting-guide-for-net-code-coverage-import/37151#not-running-all-commands-from-the-same-folder-14)Not running all commands from the same folder

All commands, including the code coverage generation, must be run from the same folder.

To check which is the base path look for this log:

```
DEBUG: The current user dir is '<PATH>'.
```

To check the path of the indexed files look for this log:

```
DEBUG: '<PATH\FILE.cs>' indexed with language 'cs'
```

or

```
DEBUG: '<PATH\FILE.vb>' indexed with language 'vb'
```

Then if the paths inside the coverage file differ from the path of the indexed files, look for this log:

```
INFO: Parsing the OpenCover report <FILE PATH>
DEBUG: Skipping file with path '<PATH\FILE.cs>' because it is not indexed or does not have the supported language.
```

or

```
INFO: Parsing the OpenCover report <FILE PATH>
DEBUG: Skipping file with path '<PATH\FILE.vb>' because it is not indexed or does not have the supported language.
```
